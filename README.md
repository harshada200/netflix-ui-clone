# 🎬 Netflix UI Clone (React)

This project is a **frontend UI clone of Netflix**, created using **React.js**.  
The aim of this project was to practice building a real-world website layout, understand React component structure, routing, and improve CSS styling by closely matching the original Netflix design.

This project was developed during my **internship learning phase** as part of daily frontend tasks and hands-on practice.
